        <p>Battle Rattle adds infantry gear to RimWorld to allow colonists to haul heavy loads, carry multiple weapons, and emergency medical gear. It's in early development and shouldn't be used in serious RimWorld sessions (aren't they all serious?)</p>

<a id="new-things" class="anchor" href="#new-things" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New Things</h3>

<h4>
<a id="holsters-slings-sheaths-scabbards-and-belts" class="anchor" href="#holsters-slings-sheaths-scabbards-and-belts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Holsters, Slings, Sheaths, Scabbards, and Belts</h4>

<ul>
<li>Drop-leg holsters for side-arms and personal defense weapons.</li>
<li>Shoulder holsters for side-arms.</li>
<li>Three-point slings for long and medium arms and a heavy sling for light machine guns.</li>
<li>Sheaths and scabbards for knifes and swords (and machetes from the <a href="https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6482.0">Thingamajigs</a> mod if you have it.)</li>
<li>If you have Skullywag's <a href="https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6034.0">Non-Lethals</a> mod, you'll also get holsters for stun guns and tazers.</li>
<li>If you have <a href="https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6482.0">Thingamajigs</a> or <a href="https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6666.30">Right Tool for the Job</a>, you'll also get the Engineer's Equipment research project and then an Engineer's Belt for carrying up to three tools, hands-free.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="pouches" class="anchor" href="#pouches" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pouches</h4>

<ul>
<li>Individual First-Aid Kit (IFAK) for battlefield self-treatment and others by colonists.</li>
<li>Trauma Kits, which are repackaged medicine for use in IFAKs or for treating down colonists in situ.</li>
<li>Grenade Pouch for â€¦ grenades!</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="production" class="anchor" href="#production" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Production</h4>

<ul>
<li>Medic's Table for repackaging regular and glitterworld medicine into trauma kits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="weapon-carriers" class="anchor" href="#weapon-carriers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weapon Carriers</h3>

<p>You can holster (or sling) a colonist's equipped weapon and then equip another weapon. Equipping a holstered weapon if one is already equipped will drop the equipped weapon, so you can drop the sniper rifle and charge that alphalo with your combat knife without losing precious seconds. A weapon carrier will keep a holstered weapon even when it's dropped, so colonists can quickly grab a their gear.</p>

<h4>
<a id="using-weapon-carriers" class="anchor" href="#using-weapon-carriers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Weapon Carriers</h4>

<ol>
<li>Wear the weapon carrier of your choice.</li>
<li>Equip a matching weapon, e.g., an assault rifle for a combat sling.</li>
<li>Make sure the colonist doing steps 1 and 2 is selected.</li>
<li>Click the button ("gizmo") to holster or sling the colonist's weapon.</li>
<li>The weapon is now saved in the colonists weapon carrier and other items can be carried and equipped without losing the slung or holstered weapon.</li>
<li>To re-equip the weapon, select the colonist again and click the draw or ready weapon button.</li>
<li>If the colonist had something else equipped when you clicked draw or ready, it will be dropped next to them.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: at the moment you have to move the mouse cursor over the various Battle Rattle buttons to see which is which, since they're all just big, red question marks.</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="rucksacks" class="anchor" href="#rucksacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rucksacks</h3>

<p>You can load a ruck much like you'd load a storage zone or container, i.e., pick what to load. You can close a ruck to stop colonists from loading it and of course wear it to haul it and its contents where ever. Once "there", drop it and pick which of the various kinds of things you'd like to unload from it. </p>

<h4>
<a id="using-rucksacks" class="anchor" href="#using-rucksacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Rucksacks</h4>

<ol>
<li>Drop the rucksack on the ground.</li>
<li>Select the rucksack.</li>
<li>Click the Pack tab over the rucksack's information window.</li>
<li>Choose what you'd like colonists to pack this rucksack with and how far from the rucksack you'd like them to get items to pack.</li>
<li>Make sure the rucksack isn't forbidden (a red x) and that at least a colonist or two has the Pack work type in the Overview.</li>
<li>Click the Pack button to the right of the rucksack's information window.</li>
<li>Select a colonist and right-click the rucksack and select Wear.</li>
<li>Go somewhere else and drop the rucksack again.</li>
<li>Select the rucksack and click the Unpack buttons for the types of things you'd like to unpack, e.g., maybe you packed it with food, logs, and medicine and just want to unpack food and logs to make a campsite.</li>
<li>The unpacked items will immediately appear next to the ruck!</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: at the moment you have to move the mouse cursor over the various Battle Rattle buttons to see which is which, since they're all just big, red question marks.</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="pouches-1" class="anchor" href="#pouches-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pouches</h3>

<p>The two pouches in the first release are the frag grenade pouch and the individual first-aid kit (IFAK.) The IFAK loaded with a trauma kit allows colonists to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Treat themselves with their own (worn) IFAK when injured and significantly bleeding.</li>
<li>Treat a downed colonist with that colonists IFAK or the responder's IFAK or any nearby.</li>
<li>And, the player can force a colonist to treat themselves with an IFAK even when the colonist doesn't feel it necessary (click on the colonist, then the Use IFAK gizmo/button.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The frag grenade pouch works exactly like weapon carriers, e.g., shoulder-holsters, but accepts fragmentation grenades.</p>

<h4>
<a id="using-ifaks" class="anchor" href="#using-ifaks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using IFAKs</h4>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you've both an empty IFAK, a trauma kit, and someone with the Doctor work type in the Overview.</li>
<li>If both the IFAK and trauma kit are available, the doctor will pack the latter into the former.</li>
<li>Select a colonist and then right-click the loaded IFAK to tell the colonist to wear it.</li>
<li>Once worn, you may force a colonist to use the IFAK on themselves by selecting the colonist and clicking the Use button to the right of the colonist's description window.</li>
<li>However, colonists will treat themselves with their own IFAK if they're bleeding badly and will treat other colonists who are down (but not dead, yet.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="medicine" class="anchor" href="#medicine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Medicine</h3>

<p>A new type of medicine, the trauma kit, allows doctors to treat downed colonists in situ, i.e., without hauling them to a medical bed first. It is also used to load IFAKs.</p>

<h4>
<a id="making-trauma-kits" class="anchor" href="#making-trauma-kits" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Making Trauma Kits</h4>

<p>A medic's table will be available once Battlefield Medicine is researched. Have an experience doctor use the table to repackage regular and glitterworld medicine packs as trauma kits. Once repackaged, these trauma kits can be packed into IFAKs or carried by hand to downed colonists anywhere for treatment.</p>

<h3>
<a id="crafting" class="anchor" href="#crafting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Crafting</h3>

<p>All crafting is done at the tailor's worktable, except for the trauma kits and the buckles; make those at the medic's and smithing tables respectively. Most rucks and carriers require a few buckles, so it can be handy to make a good few of those and keep them near a tailor's worktable.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-tech-tree" class="anchor" href="#the-tech-tree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Tech Tree</h3>

<p>First Tier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Rucks - Unlocks crafting a simple, smallish, uncomfortable pack and leads to Advanced Rucks.</li>
<li>Combat Pouches - Unlocks the grenade pouch and leads to Battlefield Medicine.</li>
<li>Sidearm Holsters - Unlocks drop-leg, shoulder, and PDW holsters and leads to Tactical Weapon Slings and Engineer's Equipment. </li>
</ul>

<p>Second Tier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Rucks - Unlocks crafting assault and long-range rucks and leads to Battlefield Medicine. Requires Basic Rucks.</li>
<li>Engineer's Equipment - Unlocks the engineer's belt, which can carry three different tools, e.g., hammers, wrenches, from other mods. Requires Sidearm Holsters.</li>
<li>Tactical Weapon Slings - Unlocks the light and heavy weapon slings. Requires Sidearm Holsters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Third Tier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battlefield Medicine - Unlocks the IFAK, the medic's ruck, the trauma kit, and the medic's worktable. Requires Advanced Rucks and Combat Pouches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="compatibility" class="anchor" href="#compatibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility</h3>

<p>Simple compatibility is achieved by using regular expressions in the XML definitions of the carriers, e.g., an anti-material rifle added by a mod can be used with the light sling because the light sling allows any weapon with "rifle" in the name.</p>

<p>Other mods require a little more effort and are listed below. I haven't played all these extensively, so my attempts and integrated them with Battle Rattle may well be missing something important. Please, let me know if that's the case or there's any other mods you'd like to see integrated.</p>
