{"name":"Battle Rattle","tagline":"Ride the express elevator to hell in full battle rattle.","body":"Battle Rattle adds infantry gear to RimWorld to allow pawns to haul heavy loads, carry multiple weapons, and emergency gear. It's in early development and shouldn't be used in serious RimWorld sessions (aren't they all serious?)\r\n\r\nSo far, what we have is some logic, some working better, some not so much. Zero textures.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Carriers\r\nThese are mostly functional, but the logic needs more polish (not to mention textures.) You can holster (or sling) a pawn's equipped weapon and then equip another weapon. Equipping a holstered weapon if one is already equipped will drop the equipped weapon, so you can drop the sniper rifle and charge that alphalo with your combat knife without losing precious seconds. A weapon carrier will keep a holstered weapon even when it's dropped, so pawns can quickly grab a their gear.\r\n\r\n1. Drop-leg holsters for side-arms and personal defense weapons.\r\n2. Shoulder holsters for side-arms.\r\n3. Three-point slings for long and medium arms and a heavy sling for light machine guns.\r\n4. Sheaths and scabbards for knifes and swords.\r\n\r\nOnce these are polished, armor with integrated holsters and sheaths will likely be next.\r\n\r\n### Rucksacks\r\nThese are also mostly functional, at the moment only one is implemented (the long-range ruck.) You can load a ruck much like you'd load a storage zone or container, i.e., pick what to load. You can close a ruck to stop pawns from loading it and of course wear it to haul it and its contents whereever. Once \"there\", drop it and pick which of the various kinds of things you'd like to unload from it. \r\n\r\nNext up will be different sized rucks and rucks with capacity bonuses for specific contents, e.g., a medic pack that can store more medical kits.\r\n\r\n### Pouches\r\nThe only pouch in the first release is the individual first-aid kit (IFAK.) The IFAK loaded with a trauma kit allows pawns to:\r\n\r\n1. Treat themselves with their own (worn) IFAK when injured and significantly bleeding.\r\n2. Treat a downed pawn with that pawns IFAK or the responder's IFAK or any nearby.\r\n3. And, the player can force a pawn to treat themselves with an IFAK even when the pawn doesn't feel it necessary (click on the pawn, then the Use IFAK gizmo/button.)\r\n\r\n### Medicine\r\nA new type of medicine, the trauma kit, allows doctors to treat downed pawns in situ, i.e., without hauling them to a medical bed first. It is also used to load IFAKs.\r\n\r\n### Credit Is Due\r\nIcons for the sheath, scabbard, and drop-leg and PDW holsters are by [Shinzy](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?action=profile;u=8918).\r\n\r\nBefore a pre-release was even ready, several intrepid RimWorld modders where patiently pointing out where to bang on the keyboard! Thanks and kudos to:\r\n\r\n* [mrofa](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?action=profile;u=2507)\r\n* [Rikki](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?action=profile;u=9181)\r\n\r\nBut, any/all mistakes are down to @Famous-Shoes; a problem with the brain being missing.\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nEven if you're not into modding, you can help by just expressing your interest or sharing your ideas and suggestions here in the [issues](https://github.com/Famous-Shoes/Battle-Rattle/issues) or the Ludeon Forums (TBD). If you'd like to pitch in, areas in need are:\r\n\r\n1. Textures. Any. All.\r\n2. Verbs/casting. Even if you just want share a few pointers, this area of RimWorld code is rather inscrutable. Or, fork and pull request!\r\n3. Or, anything you'd like to work on. You'll be most welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
